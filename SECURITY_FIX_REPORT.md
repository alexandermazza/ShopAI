# CRITICAL Security Fix Report - Store Context Data Leak

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Version:** 2.0.1

---

## üö® Issue Summary

**CRITICAL DATA ISOLATION VULNERABILITY** discovered in the Store Context feature that allowed different shops to view and modify each other's private store information.

### What Was Wrong?

The `app/routes/app.store-context.tsx` route was using an **in-memory variable** to store shop context:

```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE (REMOVED)
let storeContext = "..."; // ‚ùå SHARED ACROSS ALL SHOPS!

export async function loader({}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  return json({ storeContext }); // ‚ùå Returns same data for all shops
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  storeContext = context; // ‚ùå Overwrites for ALL shops
  return json({ success: true, storeContext });
}
```

### Attack Scenario:

1. **Shop A** (e.g., "Woof Whisperer") saves their store context with sensitive business information
2. In-memory variable is updated: `storeContext = "Woof Whisperer's context..."`
3. **Shop B** (e.g., "Shredders") opens the Store Context page
4. **Shop B sees Shop A's data!** üö®
5. **Shop B can also overwrite Shop A's context** by saving their own

### Impact:

- ‚ùå **Privacy Violation**: Shops could view competitors' business strategies, policies, and proprietary information
- ‚ùå **Data Corruption**: Shops could accidentally overwrite other shops' contexts
- ‚ùå **GDPR/Compliance**: Potential regulatory violations for data mishandling
- ‚ùå **Trust**: Major breach of merchant trust

## ‚úÖ The Fix

Replaced in-memory storage with **proper database isolation**:

```typescript
// SECURE CODE (CURRENT)
export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const { session } = await authenticate.admin(request);

  // ‚úÖ Fetch ONLY this shop's data
  const storeInfo = await prisma.storeInformation.findUnique({
    where: { shop: session.shop }, // ‚úÖ Proper isolation
    select: { additionalInfo: true }
  });

  const storeContext = storeInfo?.additionalInfo || "Default text...";

  return json({ storeContext, shop: session.shop });
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const { session } = await authenticate.admin(request);
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const context = formData.get("context");

  // ‚úÖ Save ONLY to this shop's record
  await prisma.storeInformation.upsert({
    where: { shop: session.shop }, // ‚úÖ Proper isolation
    update: { additionalInfo: context },
    create: { shop: session.shop, additionalInfo: context }
  });

  return json({ success: true, storeContext: context });
}
```

### Key Improvements:

1. ‚úÖ **Database Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL instead of in-memory variable
2. ‚úÖ **Shop Isolation**: Every query filtered by `where: { shop: session.shop }`
3. ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Uses Shopify's `authenticate.admin(request)` to get shop domain
4. ‚úÖ **Verification**: UI now displays shop name so users can verify they're seeing their own data
5. ‚úÖ **Secure by Default**: Impossible for shops to access each other's data

## üîç How to Verify the Fix

### For Developers:

1. **Run the app with multiple test shops**
2. **Save different context in each shop**
3. **Verify each shop only sees their own data**
4. **Check database**: Each `StoreInformation` record has unique `shop` field

### For Users:

1. **Look for the info banner** at the top of Store Context page
2. **Verify your shop name** is displayed correctly
3. **Your data should match your business** (not someone else's)

## üìã Remediation Checklist

- [x] Replace in-memory storage with database
- [x] Add `session.shop` authentication to loader
- [x] Add `session.shop` authentication to action
- [x] Use `prisma.findUnique({ where: { shop } })` for isolation
- [x] Add shop name display in UI for verification
- [x] Test with multiple shops
- [x] Update CHANGELOG
- [x] Build successfully
- [ ] Deploy to production immediately
- [ ] Notify affected merchants (if any data was leaked)

## üöÄ Deployment Priority

**IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED**

This is a critical security vulnerability that affects data privacy. Deploy to production as soon as possible.

### Deployment Steps:

```bash
# 1. Build the fixed version
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Fly.io
npm run deploy

# 3. Verify in production
# - Test with at least 2 different development stores
# - Confirm data isolation is working
```

## üìä Lessons Learned

### Root Causes:

1. ‚ùå **In-memory state in server routes** - Never use global variables for user data
2. ‚ùå **Missing authentication** - Original code didn't use `authenticate.admin()`
3. ‚ùå **No shop isolation** - Didn't filter database queries by shop
4. ‚ùå **Placeholder code in production** - TODO comments indicated this was temporary

### Best Practices Going Forward:

1. ‚úÖ **Always use database** for persistent data
2. ‚úÖ **Always authenticate** requests to get shop domain
3. ‚úÖ **Always filter by shop** in database queries
4. ‚úÖ **Never use global variables** for user-specific data
5. ‚úÖ **Code review** for data isolation issues
6. ‚úÖ **Test with multiple shops** during development

## üîê Similar Issues to Check

Audit all routes that handle shop-specific data:

- [x] `app/routes/app.store-context.tsx` - **FIXED**
- [x] `app/routes/app.store-information.jsx` - ‚úÖ Uses proper isolation
- [x] `app/routes/app.dashboard.tsx` - ‚úÖ Uses proper isolation
- [x] `app/routes/app.plan-setup.tsx` - ‚úÖ Uses proper isolation
- [x] `app/routes/app.pricing.tsx` - ‚úÖ Uses proper isolation

**All other routes properly use `session.shop` for data isolation.**
