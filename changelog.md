## [Unreleased] - 2024-06-04

### Fixed
- Improved Judge.me review scraping in Ask Me Anything widget:
  - Added robust waiting logic using MutationObserver and increased wait time (up to 20s) to capture reviews loaded asynchronously or after scroll.
  - Enhanced logging for easier debugging and confirmation of review capture.
  - Ensured up to 5 reviews are reliably extracted and sent to the AI context.

## [Unreleased] - 2024-06-05

### Added
- **AI Review Summary Block:**
  - Created a new Shopify block (`review-summary.liquid`) to display an AI-generated summary of product reviews.
  - Implemented review scraping logic (`review-summary.js`) similar to the Ask Me Anything block, which triggers the summary generation.
  - Added a dedicated backend resource route (`api.resource-review-summary.tsx`) to handle summarization requests using OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) via the Vercel AI SDK (`streamText`).
  - Designed the block to be hidden if no reviews are found on the page.
  - Included styling for the block header (title and icon) with a gradient effect, and a styled response area with loading/error states.

### Changed
- Minified `review-summary.js` using `terser` to `review-summary.min.js` to resolve linter file size warnings.
- Updated `review-summary.liquid` schema to reference the minified JavaScript file.
- Increased padding in the Review Summary block's response area for better text spacing.
- Refined the OpenAI prompt for the Review Summary block to request a more concise (2-3 sentence) summary.

### Fixed
- Resolved persistent error (`3:"An error occurred."`) in Review Summary block by switching from streaming (`ai` SDK) to non-streaming (`openai` SDK) API calls for the backend route (`resource-review-summary.tsx`). Root cause appeared to be an issue with the AI SDK's stream handling returning the error text within the stream itself.
- Updated frontend (`review-summary.js`) to handle the new JSON response format from the non-streaming backend endpoint.

### Removed
- Removed default star rating component provided by Shopify CLI template.

### Security
- Implemented secure storage of OpenAI API key using environment variables.

### Changed
- Minified `review-summary.js` using `terser` to `review-summary.min.js` to resolve linter file size warnings.
- Updated `review-summary.liquid` schema to reference the minified JavaScript file.

### Fixed
- Resolved Shopify linter error "The schema does not exist" in `review-summary.liquid` by removing the unnecessary `"target": "section"` property from the schema definition.
- Reduced source file size of `review-summary.js` by commenting out non-essential `console.log` statements to address linter file size warnings.

## [Unreleased] - 2024-06-06

### Changed
- Improved Review Summary block UI/UX:
  - Increased padding and max width of the summary response area for better readability and whitespace.

  - Moved attribution lower and increased its background and padding for clarity.
- Re-minified `review-summary.js` to `review-summary.min.js` to ensure latest logic is deployed.

## [Unreleased]
### Added

Supported tones: Professional & Neutral, Friendly & Conversational, Playful & Witty, Minimalist / TL;DR, Luxury / High-End, Hype & Trendy (Gen Z / TikTok Vibes), Sassy / Bold, Detailed & Analytical, Parent-Friendly / Family-Oriented, Outdoorsy / Rugged.
- The selected tone is passed to the backend and used to influence the OpenAI prompt for both review summaries and product Q&A.
- UI for tone selection added to both the review summary block and Ask Me Anything widget.

### Fixed

The response area now features a semi-transparent background, backdrop blur, soft border, and subtle light shadow for a modern, visually appealing look. No other areas or layouts were changed.

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Updated `review-summary.liquid` block: The "Powered by ShopAI" attribution now always appears below the summary body text, never overlaps, and uses a smaller, more accessible style. Switched to flexbox column layout and static positioning for consistent placement.

## [Unreleased] - 2024-06-07

### Changed
- **Backend Cleanup:**
  - Migrated all OpenAI Q&A and suggested question logic into the correct file (`shop-ai/app/routes/ask-openai.tsx`).
  - Added support for the `getSuggestedQuestions` operation to the backend route, enabling the frontend to request AI-generated suggested questions for products.
