### 3. ‚úÖ Enforced Billing on AI Features

**File:** [app/routes/resource-openai.tsx](app/routes/resource-openai.tsx#L10-L28)

**Added subscription check:**
```typescript
// Helper function to check if store has active subscription
async function hasActiveSubscription(shop: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const storeInfo = await prisma.storeInformation.findUnique({
      where: { shop },
      select: { pricingPlan, subscriptionStatus }
    });

    // Store must have Pro Plan and active subscription
    const hasProPlan = storeInfo?.pricingPlan === BILLING_PLANS.PRO;
    const isActive = !storeInfo?.subscriptionStatus ||
                     storeInfo?.subscriptionStatus === 'ACTIVE';

    return hasProPlan && isActive;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error checking subscription status:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Added check in action:**
```typescript
// Check if store has active subscription
const hasSubscription = await hasActiveSubscription(shopDomain);
if (!hasSubscription) {
  console.warn(`üö´ Subscription required for shop: ${shopDomain}`);
  return json({
    error: "This feature requires an active ShopAI Pro subscription. Please subscribe in your Shopify admin to continue using AI-powered features.",
    requiresSubscription: true
  }, { status: 402 }); // 402 Payment Required
}
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated Main App Banner

**File:** [app/routes/app._index.jsx](app/routes/app._index.jsx#L159-L171)

**Changed from:**
```jsx
<Banner title="Subscription Required" tone="warning">
  <p>You need an active subscription to use ShopAI. Start your free trial today!</p>
</Banner>
```

**To:**
```jsx
<Banner title="Subscription Required" tone="warning">
  <p>You need an active ShopAI Pro subscription to use AI features on your product pages.</p>
</Banner>
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Customer Experience (Merchants)

#### 1. **App Installation**
- Merchant installs ShopAI from Shopify App Store
- No billing prompt initially
- They can access the admin dashboard
- Banner shows: "Subscription Required - Subscribe Now"

#### 2. **When They Try to Add Components**
Merchants can add the theme extension blocks to their product pages:
- "Ask Me Anything" block
- "Review Summary" block

**However, the blocks won't work without a subscription.**

#### 3. **When Customers Try to Use Features**
When a customer on the storefront tries to ask a question:

**Without Subscription:**
```
‚ùå Error: "This feature requires an active ShopAI Pro subscription.
   Please subscribe in your Shopify admin to continue using AI-powered features."
```

**With Subscription:**
```
‚úÖ AI responds with product answer
```

#### 4. **Subscription Flow**
1. Merchant clicks "Subscribe Now" button ‚Üí redirected to `/app/pricing`
2. Reviews plan: $15/month, no trial
3. Clicks "Subscribe Now" ‚Üí redirected to Shopify billing page
4. Shopify shows:
   - Plan: Pro Plan
   - Price: $15.00 USD every 30 days
   - **First charge happens immediately**
5. Merchant clicks "Approve"
6. **Charged $15 immediately**
7. Redirected to dashboard with success message
8. AI features now work on storefront

---

## Technical Implementation

### Billing Check Logic

The AI route checks subscription status by querying the database:

```typescript
const storeInfo = await prisma.storeInformation.findUnique({
  where: { shop },
  select: { pricingPlan, subscriptionStatus }
});

// Store must have:
// 1. pricingPlan = "Pro Plan"
// 2. subscriptionStatus = "ACTIVE" (or null for backwards compatibility)
const hasProPlan = storeInfo?.pricingPlan === BILLING_PLANS.PRO;
const isActive = !storeInfo?.subscriptionStatus ||
                 storeInfo?.subscriptionStatus === 'ACTIVE';

return hasProPlan && isActive;
```

### Response Handling

**Subscription check happens BEFORE any AI processing:**
- ‚úÖ No OpenAI API calls if no subscription
- ‚úÖ No wasted API costs
- ‚úÖ Clear error message to merchant

**HTTP Status Code:** `402 Payment Required`
- Semantic status code for "subscription needed"
- Frontend can detect and show appropriate message

---

## What Merchants See

### Without Subscription

**Admin Dashboard:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Subscription Required
You need an active ShopAI Pro subscription to use AI features on your product pages.
[Subscribe Now]
```

**Storefront (when customer asks question):**
```
This feature requires an active ShopAI Pro subscription.
Please subscribe in your Shopify admin to continue using AI-powered features.
```

### With Subscription

**Admin Dashboard:**
```
‚úÖ Welcome to ShopAI Pro!
Your subscription is now active. Enjoy unlimited AI-powered customer questions!
```

**Storefront:**
```

```

## Billing Lifecycle

### Subscription States

1. **No Subscription**
   - `pricingPlan`: `null`
   - `subscriptionStatus`: `null`
   - AI features: ‚ùå Blocked

2. **Active Subscription**
   - `pricingPlan`: `"Pro Plan"`
   - `subscriptionStatus`: `"ACTIVE"` or `null`
   - AI features: ‚úÖ Enabled

3. **Cancelled Subscription**
   - `pricingPlan`: `"Pro Plan"` (until expiry)
   - `subscriptionStatus`: `"CANCELLED"`
   - AI features: ‚ùå Blocked

4. **Expired Subscription**
   - `pricingPlan`: `"Pro Plan"` (historical)
   - `subscriptionStatus`: `"EXPIRED"`
   - AI features: ‚ùå Blocked

### Database Updates

**Subscription activated (via billing callback):**
```typescript
await prisma.storeInformation.update({
  where: { shop },
  data: {
    pricingPlan: "Pro Plan",
    planStartDate: new Date(),
  }
});
```

**Subscription updated (via webhook):**
```typescript
// When status = ACTIVE
await updateStorePlan({ shop, plan: "Pro Plan" });

// When status = CANCELLED or EXPIRED
// (currently logged, could revert to free plan)
```
