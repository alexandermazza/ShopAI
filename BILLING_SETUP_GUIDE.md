# ShopAI Billing Setup Guide

## Overview
ShopAI now has a complete Shopify Billing API integration that allows you to monetize your app with a **$15/month Pro Plan** including a **7-day free trial**.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Billing Configuration** (`app/utils/billing.server.ts`)
- Configured Pro Plan at $15/month with 7-day free trial
- Unlimited questions for Pro subscribers
- 100 questions/month limit for free tier

### 2. **Subscription Middleware** (`app/utils/billing-check.server.ts`)
- `requireBilling()` - Enforces subscription requirement
- `getBillingStatus()` - Checks current subscription status
- `requestSubscription()` - Initiates billing flow

### 3. **User Interface** (`app/routes/app.pricing.tsx`)
- Beautiful Polaris-based pricing page
- Clear feature breakdown
- One-click subscription with free trial

### 4. **Billing Flow**
1. User installs app
2. Dashboard shows "Subscription Required" banner
3. User clicks "View Pricing" ‚Üí sees pricing page
4. User clicks "Start 7-Day Free Trial"
5. Redirected to Shopify billing confirmation
6. After approval ‚Üí redirected back to `/app/billing/callback`
7. Subscription activated ‚Üí unlimited questions enabled

### 5. **Webhook Handling** (`webhooks/subscriptions/update`)
- Tracks subscription status changes (ACTIVE, CANCELLED, EXPIRED)
- Automatically updates database when subscriptions change
- Configured in `shopify.app.toml`

### 6. **Database Schema** (Prisma)
Added new fields to `StoreInformation` model:
- `subscriptionId` - Shopify subscription ID
- `subscriptionStatus` - Current status (ACTIVE, CANCELLED, etc.)
- `trialEndsAt` - When free trial ends

## How to Test

### Development Mode (No Charges)
The billing system is set to **test mode** in development:
```typescript
isTest: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ You can test the full billing flow
- ‚úÖ Shopify shows the confirmation UI
- ‚ùå No actual charges are made
- ‚úÖ Works on development stores

### Testing Steps:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Install app on a development store
3. Navigate to the dashboard
4. Click "View Pricing"
5. Click "Start 7-Day Free Trial"
6. Approve in Shopify admin
7. You'll be redirected back with active subscription

## Production Deployment

### Before Deploying to Production:

     - Billing interval: Every 30 days
     - Trial period: 7 days

#### 2. **Configure App Listing**
   - Set app pricing in Partners dashboard
